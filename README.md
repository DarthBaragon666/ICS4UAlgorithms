ICS4U unit on algorithms

11/26/2018 Questions:
1: What did I learn about algorithms (today)?
A: I already knew that an algorithm is a set of finite steps that can be repeated to do something, such as divide numbers with long division, find a route on a gps, and as I learned today, to solve a rubik's cube.
2: How do I know this was algorithmic?
A: There was a finite set of steps to get to each goal in solving the rubik's cube, which were repeated when we didn't get the right result.
3: What is an algorithm to you?
A: An algorithm to me is a finite set of easy to follow steps to get to a goal efficiently. Algorithms are used more than people might think, and they are very interesting to learn about and use.
